class PluginTaskManager:
    """
    Manager of tasks that makes it simpler and easier to use workers in Plugins.
    Parts of your plugin don't need to manage tasks themselves but get
    called when something interesting happens.

    How to use:
    1) Make your plugin an Observable.
    2) Create a PluginTaskManager() in your plugin.
    3) Give the manager e.g. to controllers and other parts of your plugin that need
       to start tasks.
    4) Call create_background_task() to add tasks, or add you own task that inherits
       from TaskInterface via add_task().

        """
        Creates a managed background task.

        The task is started automatically during the next recent_events.
        If you want to start it immediately, you can call start() on the returned task.

        Right after you created the task, you can call add_observer on the returned
        task to get notified when your task completes, yields results etc.
        See tasklib.interface.py for a list of all events you can add observers to.

        Args:
            name (String): Name of the process for the task, only for identification
                purposes. Multiple processes might have the same name.
            routine_or_generator_function (Callable): Your task. Supports generator
                functions (= methods and functions that yield results) and routines
                (= methods and functions without yield).
            args: Arguments for the task.
            kwargs: Keyword arguments for the task.
            pass_shared_memory: If True, a shared memory object will be passed to the
                task (see tasklib.background.shared_memory.py). For this to work,
                your task needs to accept a keyword argument `shared_memory`.
            patches (collection of Patch): Patches that will be applied to your
                background process right after start. Use them if you need to fix
                something in the environment of the new process (see
                tasklib.background.patches.py).
                Per default, the IPC logging is patched.

        Returns:
            A new task with base class TaskInterface.
