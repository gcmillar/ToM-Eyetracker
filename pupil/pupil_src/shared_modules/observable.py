    An object that allows to add observers to any of its methods. See
    the docstring for add_observer for more information.
    """

    def add_observer(self, method_name, observer):
        """
        Adds an observer to a method. An observer is an arbitrary callable. Every time
        the method is invoked, the observer will be called.

        The observer is called with the same arguments as the method, so make sure
        that the observer can handle these arguments!

        You cannot add observers to static and class methods.

        It's possible to add multiple observers to the same method.

        Observers are called AFTER the method completed. Even if the method raises an
        exception, observers are still called.
        Observers should NOT raise exceptions. If they do, exceptions are wrapped
        in an ObserverError and raised to the caller of the method.

        You only add the observer to this instance of the class. The observer is not
        triggered for calls to the same method of a different instance of the class.

        If the observer is a bound (i.e. non-static) method, it is safe to delete the
        corresponding object the observer is bound to. In this case, the observer
        will be ignored automatically. No need to remove it before deletion.

        Never use a bound method as an observer unless the corresponding object is
        still referenced somewhere else. Observables will only keep weak references
        to bound methods s.t. the objects can get deleted safely (see above).
        However, this means that the object will get garbage collected if its only
        referenced from an Observable. Use a callable class or lambda in this case.

        Args:
            method_name (String): The name of a bound method to which the observer
                will be added. Unbound methods (i.e. static and class methods) are NOT
                supported.
            observer (Callable): Will be called every time the method is invoked.

        Raises:
            AttributeError: The attribute specified by method_name is not found in
                the class
            TypeError: The attribute specified by method_name is
                1) no method, or
                2) a class or static method.

        """
        Removes a specific observer from a method. You have to specify the same
        callable as you added before.

        Caveat: Removing lambdas does not work with this function. For example,
        the following will fail:
        > add_observer("foo", lambda: 1)
        > remove_observer("foo", lambda: 1)
        The two lambdas do the same but are two distinct objects.
        Your only option is to call remove_all_observers(), which also deletes lambdas.

        Args:
            method_name (String): Name of a bound method to which the observer was
                added before.

        ever added, it raises an ValueError.
